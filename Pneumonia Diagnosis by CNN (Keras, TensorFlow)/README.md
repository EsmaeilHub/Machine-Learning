</div>

Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, causing them to fill with fluid or pus. This can lead to symptoms such as cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. Pneumonia can be caused by various infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and can range from mild to severe, with potentially life-threatening complications in certain cases.

## <b>1.1 <span style='color:#e61227'>|</span> Diagnosis</b>

The diagnosis of pneumonia typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Your doctor will begin by asking about your symptoms and medical history, including any recent illnesses or exposure to infectious agents. During the physical exam, your doctor may listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for abnormal sounds such as crackling or bubbling, which can indicate pneumonia.

In addition to the physical exam, your doctor may recommend the following diagnostic tests:

- **Chest X-ray**: This imaging test allows your doctor to visualize the lungs and identify any abnormalities suggestive of pneumonia, such as inflammation, fluid accumulation, or lung consolidation.
- **Blood tests**: Blood tests can help confirm the presence of infection and may be used to identify the specific organism causing pneumonia, although precise identification is not always possible.
- **Pulse oximetry**: This non-invasive test measures the oxygen level in your blood, which can be affected by pneumonia-induced lung inflammation.
- **Sputum test**: A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) may be collected and analyzed to help identify the causative organism and guide treatment decisions.

Treatment for pneumonia aims to cure the infection and alleviate symptoms while preventing complications. The specific treatment approach will depend on several factors, including the type and severity of pneumonia, your age, and overall health status. Common treatment options include:

- **Antibiotics**: Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial pneumonia, and the choice of antibiotic will depend on factors such as the suspected organism and antibiotic resistance patterns. If pneumonia is caused by a virus or fungus, antiviral or antifungal medications may be prescribed instead.
- **Supportive care**: Supportive measures such as rest, hydration, and fever management may help alleviate symptoms and promote recovery. In some cases, supplemental oxygen therapy may be needed to ensure adequate oxygenation of the blood.
- **Hospitalization**: Severe cases of pneumonia, particularly those involving complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis, may require hospitalization for close monitoring and intensive treatment, including intravenous antibiotics and respiratory support.
